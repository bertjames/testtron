                    <h2></h2>
                    <p>TRON is a blockchain-based decentralized protocol that aims to construct a worldwide free content entertainment system with the blockchain and distributed storage technology. The protocol allows each user to freely publish, store and
                        own data, and in the decentralized autonomous form, decides the distribution, subscription and push of contents and enables content creators by releasing, circulating and dealing with digital assets, thus forming a decentralized
                        content entertainment ecosystem.</p>
                    <p>Peiwo App with over 10 million users will become the first TRON-compatible entertainment APP.</p>

                <article>
                    <h2></h2>
                    <p>TRON's team members are followers of Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who are convinced that protocol, from the moment of its invention, is an asset for human beings, rather than a profit-making tool for small groups. Hence, TRON has established
                        the Singapore-based Tron Foundation, a nonprofit organization that mainly engages in operating the TRON network in the principles of openness, fairness and transparency and supporting TRON's development team.</p>
                    <p>The Tron Foundation is set up with the approval of the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and under supervision and regulation of the Company Law of Singapore. It is run by the Board of Trustees or the Board of Governors
                        formed by eligible trustees for independent management and operation, which is also independent from the government's administration.</p>
                    <p>Singapore is renowned for its stable and well-established laws and financial environment. As a nonprofit entity established in Singapore, the Tron Foundation, subject to the laws of Singapore, is a legal entity having no commercial
                        interest that supports and engages in activities for public or private benefits. The “profits” obtained by the Foundation are deemed surplus and will be retained for the organization and implementation of other activities and events.
                        Members of the Foundation will never partake any distribution of profits.</p>

                <h2 class=title>Value of TRON</h2>
                <div class=values>
                    <h3>In the beginning of designing TRON, the following core values are always adhered to:</h3>
                    <article>
                        <p>1.Date creators (users) will have the fundamental ownership of data, and the internet should be decentralized. This was proposed by doctor Tim Berners-Lee at the time when the internet was born and the original intention for creation
                            of the internet.</p>
                        <p>2.Those who make a contribution to ecological TRON will be entitled to proportional profits according to rules. A value network has the greatest advantage that may digitally capitalize anything in social and media networks.</p>
                        <p>3.All forms of contribution should be of equal quantitative value. Substantially, the time invested by participants, excellent contents created and attention are of the measure value as equal as the furnished capitals.</p>
                        <p>4.The fundamental objective of TRON is to provide services for the public. As an ecology operated by a non-profit foundation, TRON is designed to serve the masses who enjoy content entertainment throughout the world, rather than
                            for the purpose of gaining profits. All TRON participants will benefit from its prosperity.</p>
                        <p>5.Contents should derive from people rather than capitals which should be used to reward people rather than to control people. Cultural and creative industries should be mainly driven by the pursuit of the quality of art and contents
                            by content creators, artists and scriptwriters rather than the capitalists who consume no contents.</p>

            <h2 class=title>Characteristics of TRON</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>As a decentralized content protocol, TRON is of the following four basic characteristics compared with the centralized internet:</h3> <span>Data liberation: on a free and uncontrolled basis, the contents including characters, pictures, audios and videos may be unloaded, stored and spread.</span><span>Content enabling: digital assets are obtained through provision and spread of contents, thus economically stimulating the enabling of content ecology.</span><span>Personal ICO: an individual may freely distribute digital assets in the form of ICO, while others may enjoy the benefits and services brought due to the continuous development of data contributors by purchasing digital assets. </span><span>Infrastructure: with distributed digital assets will be equipped with a complete set of decentralized infrastructures, including distributed exchange, autonomous gaming, forecast and game system.</span>                </div>

        <div class=trx id=trx>
            <div>
                <h2>TRONIX—Offical Token of TRON</h2>
                <p>TRON’s official currency is TRONIX. TRONIX is the basic unit of accounts in TRON’s blockchain. The value of all other tokens are derived from the value of TRON.</p>
                <p>TRON Power (TP) TP is locked TRON. Users can acquire TP by locking their TRONIX. TP, in nature, is TRONIX with voting right, which means TP holders have more privileges in the ecosystem. </p>
                <p>TRON 20 TOKEN Content owners (IPs, individuals, and groups) can issue their digital assets freely through TRON 20 standards, while others can enjoy the benefits and services brought by the constant growth of data contributor by buying
                    these digital assets.</p>
